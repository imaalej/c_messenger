# C_messenger

A little project to explore network programming in C facilitating communication between multiple clients through a server leveraging TCP stream sockets and threads. This should only work for unix.

Todo:
- ~~Change clients from processes to threads~~
- ~~Add mutex locks for safety once threads are implemented~~
- handle disconnects
- Allow customization of bound port and address.
- Add time and client information into broadcast messages for clarity
- Backend to store messages
